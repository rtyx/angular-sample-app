# AngularClient

This project showcases a basic Angular client with authentication and a display of data on a table.

It is connected to a dummy API that provides, consequentially, dummy data. It's not properly authenticating (checking the email, checking the password, hashing and salting...) but it serves as an example of a happy scenario on the back end.
